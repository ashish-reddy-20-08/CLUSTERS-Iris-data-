# CLUSTERING OF THE IRIS DATA-SET.

**In this project we will go through Iris data data set and perform k Means clustering and form clusters**

## K-MEANS CLUSTERING 

- K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.

- The main objective of the K-Means algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the points and their respective cluster centroid.

## Example:

## Advantages of k-means

Relatively simple to implement.

Scales to large data sets.

Guarantees convergence.

Can warm-start the positions of centroids.

Easily adapts to new examples.

Generalizes to clusters of different shapes and sizes, such as elliptical cluster

## How does the K-Means Algorithm Work?

The working of the K-Means algorithm is explained in the below steps:


Step-2: Select random K points or centroids. (It can be other from the input dataset).

Step-1: Select the number K to decide the number of clusters.

Step-3: Assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters.

Step-4: Calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.
