# CLUSTERING OF THE IRIS DATA-SET.

## K-MEANS CLUSTERING 

- K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.

- The main objective of the K-Means algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the points and their respective cluster centroid.

**In this project we will go through Iris data data set and perform k Means clustering and form clusters**
